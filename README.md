# Pokédex Guessing Game

## Description
A fun web-based game where players try to guess the correct Pokémon based on a randomly displayed Pokédex entry. Players have three attempts per entry and receive hints based on how close their guess is to the correct Pokémon.

## How to Play
1. Click the **Start** button to begin the game.
2. A random Pokédex entry will appear on the screen.
3. Enter your guess in the input field and submit.
4. If your guess is correct (or at least 80% similar), move to the next Pokémon.
5. If incorrect, receive a hint:
   - **"Warm"** if your guess is close.
   - **"Cold"** if your guess is far off.
6. You have up to **3 attempts** before the correct answer is revealed.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML** for structuring the game interface.
- **CSS** for styling the Pokédex-like design.
- **JavaScript** for game logic and interactivity.
